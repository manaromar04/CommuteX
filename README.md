## 📱 Key Workflows

### Driver Trip Completion Flow

1. Driver has accepted bookings from multiple passengers
2. Driver clicks "Complete Trip" in My Trips modal
3. System calculates:
   - Total fare from all passengers
   - Driver earnings (65% of total)
   - RTA commission (35% of total)
4. Driver wallet is credited with 65%
5. Success notification shows exact earnings breakdown

### Passenger Booking Flow

1. Passenger searches for available trips
2. Selects a trip and chooses number of seats
3. System checks wallet balance
4. Passenger confirms booking
5. Wallet is debited with trip fare
6. Reward points awarded based on trip type

### Voucher Redemption

1. Passenger/Driver redeems reward points
2. Receives discount vouchers for:
   - **Salik** (toll tags) - Varying discounts
   - **RTA** (registration & licensing)
   - **ADNOC** (fuel)
3. Points deducted from reward balance
4. Voucher code generated with expiration date

## 💳 Commission & Pricing Model

### Trip Commission Split (65/35)

When a passenger books a trip:

- **Driver receives**: 65% of fare amount
- **RTA receives**: 35% of fare amount (platform commission)

### Example

- Passenger pays: 100 AED
- Driver gets: 65 AED (credited to wallet)
- RTA gets: 35 AED
- Driver wallet updates immediately after trip completion

### Reward Points System

- **Carpool Trip (3+ passengers)**: 80 points per trip
- **Park & Ride Booking**: 40 points per booking
- **Bonus Multipliers**: Based on tier level (Bronze → Platinum)
